<h2>My Favorite Quote 1</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
    "I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-killer.
    Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
    I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass over me and through me. 
    And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. 
    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.  Only I will remain."
